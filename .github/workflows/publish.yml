        # --provenance flag enables build attestation (SLSA Level 2)
        # This creates a Provenance section on npm package page showing:
        # - Build environment (GitHub Actions)
        # - Source commit
        # - Build workflow file
        # - Public ledger entry (transparency log)
        # If using granular token instead, set NPM_TOKEN secret in repository settings
